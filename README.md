# mpthree (Client)

Client website which allows users to upload and play MP3 files.

## Description

This website was created as part of a final project in the university course Web Development with Javascript and is based on React. The authentication is done with Firebase and multiple pages have been created within React with React Router. The design was kept very simple for the project's sake but in the future i plan to hopefully develop this further.

## Getting Started

Note that to have this website fully functioning in a local environment you'll need to install and run my API from [https://github.com/sawa2005/mpthree-api/] and fill in the necessary environment variables.

### Dependencies

* npm [https://www.npmjs.com/]
* Firebase Authentication [https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth]
* mpthree API [https://github.com/sawa2005/mpthree-api/]

### Installing

* Clone this repository by running the following command in a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/sawa2005/mpthree-client.git
```
* Install npm (React is installed with an npm package in the next step).
* Install all the npm packages needed using the following command:
```
npm i
```
* Install and run the API (instructions in its repository)
* Create Firebase project & enable authentication, then connect it to the app by entering environment variables [https://youtu.be/PKwu15ldZ7k]

### Executing program

* To run the app in localhost simply use (run the API with the same command first in a seperate terminal):
```
npm start
```
